# MechanicsSphere

Ongoing repository of projects and tools that tackle advanced mechanics problems in python/C++/Julia. This repo is all about figuring out fun problems related to rigid body dynamics, dynamics of chaos, structural mechanics and variational calculus (applied to mechanics problems).
